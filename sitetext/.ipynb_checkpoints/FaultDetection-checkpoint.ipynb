    "The case in the Figure consists of a light, a resistor, a ground connection and a switch. The components outside the marked area remain out of scope, although they may still influence fault detection. The evidence for the fault detection has been confined to:\n",
    "- the position of the switch (S<sub>1</sub>), \n",
    "- the voltage V<sub>0</sub> before the light,\n",
    "- the voltage V<sub>1</sub> between the light and the resistor, and\n",

    "Given a closed switch (S<sub>1</sub>=1), the design engineer may hope to detect the failure modes using the voltage measurements but given an open switch (S<sub>1</sub>=0), the design engineer will fail to detect any of the failure modes using the voltage measurements. The voltage measurements only detect faults at a closed switch (S<sub>1</sub>=1). To detect faults at an open switch, other measurements should be introduced. In this way, the engineer may improve the health monitoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "An FMEA may suffice for the reliability engineering practice. However, for fault detection, the system states are more important. In this case, the system state follows from six binary failure modes and one binary switch. So, the number of system states $n$ is tentatively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ n= 2^{6} \\times 2 = 128 $\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a short circuit and an open circuit of a light or a resistor cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore, the number of system states $n$ reduces to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ n= (2^{6} - 2^{4} - 2^{4} + 2^{2} ) \\times 2 =72 $\n",
    "\n",
    "The FMEA already showed that the voltage measurements are informative about the system state, i.e. the ordered lists (V<sub>0</sub>=0, V<sub>1</sub>=0, V<sub>2</sub>=0) and (V<sub>0</sub>=5, V<sub>1</sub>=0, V<sub>2</sub>=0) map to different subsets of the possible system states. Still, the FMEA also showed that the ordered list (V<sub>0</sub>=0, V<sub>1</sub>=0, V<sub>2</sub>=0) does *not* map to a unique system state. So, the system state is *just partially* identifiable from the voltage measurements.\n",

    "The engineer often reduces his analysis burden by using a top-down FMEA rather than the bottom-up FMEA that has been introduced here. A top-down FMEA departs from the assigned functions. Let the assigned function be \n",

    "which reduces the analysis burden. These kinds of simplifications are common practice in conventional Reliability Centred Maintenance implementations to compose a proactive maintenance policy. However, the $72-24$ irrelevant system states may still occur in practice and fault detection may still be required during these irrelevant, but possible system states. Even in this simple case, the engineer may be required to assess the signatures of *72* system states. State space explosions are a common concern as each state requires attention.\n",
    "\n",

Therefore the distance $d$ to the various predefined signatures is calculated before the minimum will be chosen:\n",

    "    \n",
    "The calculation of $min(d)$ requires a choice of a scaler that determines the weight of the switch position with respect to the voltages. The script does not rescale the measurements. So, the voltages range from 0 to 5 V and the switch position is just a binary 0 or 1. The predefined signature $[V_{0,s},V_{1,s}, V_{2,s}, S_{1,s}]$ that satisfies $min(d)$, will be deemed as applicable. To warn for measurements that are very different from the predefined signatures, $min(d)$ should not surpass some limit:\n",

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, a proactive maintenance policy is often composed from a top-down FMEA whereas fault detection should in principle work at all possible system states. Even if these system states are not deemed as critical. Still, an FMEA may be helpful to determine the system states. Reliability engineers often deem a top-down FMEA as tedious. It should be realised that an analysis of all possible system states is even more labour intensive. In this simple case, the identification of the signature of all system is still tractable but state space explosions are often a concern.\n",
