    "# Oil analysis using random forest classification \n",
    "The essentials of a random forest are best illustrated by introducing its decision trees first. A decision tree shows how well a partitioning of the data predicts a label that has been assigned to the data. The picture shows the measurements ($x$,$y$) that have been labelled \"ocker\" or \"green\". The outlined circle represents two identical measurements ($x$,$y$) that differ in label. Therefore, the data cannot be partitioned into sets of identical labels. \n",
