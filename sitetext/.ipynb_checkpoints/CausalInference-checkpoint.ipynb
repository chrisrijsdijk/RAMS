    "# Causal inference applied to an electric circuit\n",
    "This will be a case of causal inference applied to a simple electric circuit. The primary function of this circuit will be defined by a specific causal relationship, i.e. the position of the switch should *cause* the light to be on or off. Failure modes will *cause* a specific perturbation in the primary function. Statistical associations are generally insufficient to identify causalities. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) will be introduced as a representation of the expert knowledge that should be presumed to identify a causality by a statistical association. This case will *apply* machine learning to detect faults using causal inference. The practical challenges rather than the theoretical foundations will be important here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case will firstly introduce the circuit. It will proceed by inferring a causality between the switch and the light. Then, it will introduce a single failure mode that *causes* a perturbation in the primary function. Finally, the case will be generalised to multiple failure modes. The script will revisit the case using extended, realistic time series using a random forest algorithm and k-means clustering.\n",

    "- the voltage V<sub>1</sub> over one resistor.\n",

So, a decision maker who *cannot* directly observe the failure modes $F_{1},F_{2},F_{3},F_{4}$, may still learn about $F_{1},F_{2},F_{3},F_{4}$ by observing their (voltage) effect. Therefore, the clusters in Figure 2 may indicate the hidden state of the circuit.\n",

For example, claiming the statistical independence $Pr(V_{0}|S_{1})=Pr(V_{0})$ is equivalent to claiming the statistical independence $Pr(S_{1}|V_{0})=Pr(S_{1})$. However, claiming that the voltage $V_{0}$ does not cause the switch position $S_{1}$ does not exclude the possibility that the switch position $S_{1}$ causes the voltage $V_{0}$. This example illustrates that a causality is *generally not* equal to a statistical dependency. Still, a causality is *sometimes* equal to a statistical dependency. In the specific case that the causal interactions can be represented in a DAG, Judea Pearl showed how to identify a causality from a statistical dependency. This is an important result because a statistical dependency can be estimated from observed frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "This Section will infer a causality from the time series in Figure 1 together with the presumed DAG $V_{0} \\leftarrow S_{1} \\rightarrow V_{1}$. This DAG implies that the position of the switch $S_{1}$ *causes* the voltages. The direct assessment of a causality is problematic as the counterfactual reality remains unobserved. For example, the time series show that the switch $S_{1}$ closed at a time $t=5$, but they do not show what would have happened if the switch were *not* closed at the time $t=5$. Therefore, the effect of that specific closure of the switch is *not* directly observable. So, the time series just list the values that *occurred* but not the values that *could have occurred* had the switch been in another position. The challenge now is to infer the causal effect of an intervention on the switch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, an average voltage at given a switch position can be calculated. For example, the average voltage $\\overline{V}_{0}$ given an open switch $S_{1}=0$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$  [\\overline{V}_{0}|S_{1}=0]=0,0V $\n",
    "\n",
    "The average voltage $V_{0}$ given a closed switch $S_{1}=1$ is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the voltage recordings at a closed switch are completely separated from those at an open switch as illustrated in Figure 2. Therefore, these voltages are likely to come from different random experiments which makes the difference in means above *statistically significant*. Still, this statistical dependency may be explained in various ways. By presuming the DAG $V_{0} \\leftarrow S_{1} \\rightarrow V_{1}$, the difference in expectation equals the average treatment effect (ATE) of the switch $S_{1}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "The ATE of the switch $S_{1}$ on the voltage $V_{0}$ indicates a *causal* response to the switch. This move from a difference in expectations to an ATE is *not* trivial. For an in depth explanation on how to identify an ATE from statistical associations, a textbook on causal inference should be consulted. Here, it is just stated as a fact that the additional knowledge represented by the DAG $V_{0} \\leftarrow S_{1} \\rightarrow V_{1}$ is needed to identify the ATE of the switch $S_{1}$ on the voltage $V_{0}$. This knowledge may seem evident to those who took classes in electronics and one may design various experiments to substantiate this DAG, but the DAG does *not* follow from the observed time series in Figure 1. For example, the DAG $V_{1} \\leftarrow V_{0}\\rightarrow S_{1}$ may well produce the same time series but an *intervention* on the switch $S_{1}$ would not change the voltages then. Therefore, the time series by themselves do not suffice to identify the ATE of the switch. Presumptions represented in the DAG are essential.\n",

    "A more careful analysis of the time series in Figure 1 reveals that the voltages at a closed switch $S_{1}=1$ cluster differently. In particular, the voltages during the time interval $t=[41:49]$ differ from the other ones. A *causal explanation* is desirable for this anomalous behaviour. As constant causes cannot reveal their effects, this anomalous behaviour of the voltages cannot be explained by the switch position, there must be an unobserved background variable $B$ at work. This Section will extend the example with the background variable $B$ presuming a DAG that implies that both $S_{1}$ and $B$ are confounders of the voltages. So, the extended DAG is:\n",
