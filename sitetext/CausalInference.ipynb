    "This Section will infer a causality from the time series in Figure 1 together with the presumed DAG $V_{0} \\leftarrow S_{1} \\rightarrow V_{1}$. This DAG implies that the position of the switch $S_{1}$ *causes* the voltages. The direct assessment of a causality is problematic as the counterfactual reality remains unobserved. For example, the time series show that the switch $S_{1}$ closed at a time $t=5$, but they do not show what would have happened if the switch were *not* closed at the time $t=5$. Therefore, the effect of that specific closure of the switch is *not* directly observable. So, the time series just list the values that *occurred* but not the values that *could have occurred* had the switch been in another position. The challenge now is to infer the causal effect of an intervention on the switch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, an average voltage at given a switch position can be calculated. For example, the average voltage $\\overline{V}_{0}$ given an open switch $S_{1}=0$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$  [\\overline{V}_{0}|S_{1}=0]=0,0V $\n",

    "From the above equations a difference in expectations can be estimated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ E[V_{0}|S_{1}=1]-E[V_{0}|S_{1}=0] = [\\overline{V}_{0}|S_{1}=1] - [\\overline{V}_{0}|S_{1}=0] = 3,2 - 0,0 = 3,2V $\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the voltage recordings at a closed switch are completely separated from those at an open switch as illustrated in Figure 2. Therefore, these voltages are likely to come from different random experiments which makes the difference in means above *statistically significant*. Still, this statistical dependency may be explained in various ways. By presuming the DAG $V_{0} \\leftarrow S_{1} \\rightarrow V_{1}$, the difference in expectation equals the average treatment effect (ATE) of the switch $S_{1}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "This equality of ATE and the difference in expectations is *not* trivial. For an in depth explanation on how to identify an ATE a textbook on causal inference should be consulted. Here, it is just stated as a fact that the additional knowledge represented by the DAG $V_{0} \\leftarrow S_{1} \\rightarrow V_{1}$ is needed to identify the ATE of the switch $S_{1}$ on the voltage $V_{0}$. This knowledge may seem evident to those who took classes in electronics and one may design various experiments to substantiate this DAG, but the DAG does *not* follow from the observed time series in Figure 1. For example, the DAG $V_{1} \\leftarrow V{0}\\rightarrow S_{1}$ may well produce the same time series but an *intervention* on the switch $S_{1}$ would not change the voltages then. Therefore, the time series by themselves do not suffice to identify the ATE of the switch. Presumptions represented in the DAG are essential.\n",

    "A more careful analysis of the time series in Figure 1 reveals that the voltages at a closed switch $S_{1}=1$ cluster differently. In particular, the voltages during the time interval $t=[40:49]$ differ from the other ones. A *causal explanation* is desirable for this anomalous behaviour. As constant causes cannot reveal their effects, this anomalous behaviour of the voltages cannot be explained by the switch position, there must be an unobserved background variable $B$ at work.
