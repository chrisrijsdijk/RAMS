# About the repository
This repository contains some very simple scripts supporting an introductory course on Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Supportability (RAMS). A survey of these scripts and their input files can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrisrijsdijk/RAMS/). Here is a survey of the scripts:
- [Homogenous Poisson process](/sitetexts/homogenouspoissonprocess.md).
- [State transition matrix](/sitetexts/statetransitionmatrix.md).
