# About the repository
This repository contains some very simple scripts supporting an introductory course on Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Supportability (RAMS). Here is a survey of the scripts:
- [Homogenous Poisson process](PoissonDistribution.ipynb).
- [State transition matrix](/sitetexts/statetransitionmatrix.md).
