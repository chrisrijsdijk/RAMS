# About the repository
This repository contains some very simple scripts supporting an introductory course on Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Supportability (RAMS). A survey of these scripts and their input files can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrisrijsdijk/RAMS/).

# Homogenous Poisson process
This [script](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrisrijsdijk/RAMS/blob/master/PoissonDistribution.ipynb) may be interesting to operating organisations that only have Computerised Maintenance Management System (CMMS) data available. CMMS data is typically event data that has been entered by human beings and it is therefore prone to humans factors. This [paper](https://www.phmpapers.org/index.php/phme/article/view/409) provides a realistic application of this script while outlining that this basic analysis may be enriched with sensor data.
